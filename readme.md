# Catgans
## Overview

Catgans is a project that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images of cats. The goal is to create realistic and diverse cat images using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Generate 64x64 cat images
- Configurable GAN architecture

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate cat images, use the following command:

```
python generator.py
```
## Training
we will implement a cli to train on custom datasets.
